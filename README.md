 Learning Redux and Redux Toolkit and Thunk

 Three Main Principle of Redux:
 1> Single Source Of Truth (Global State) 
 2> Immutable Updates (State Read-Only)
 3> Reducer Should be Pure (No Side-Effects)

 Store.Subscribe() means it will encounter every time when the state of store changes
 setInterval() means it will execute the statement after every specified time.
 store.getState() means it use to get current State of the store

 store use to save the state of our application.
 reducer use to return new redux store according to the dispatched action.

 middleware is in between the dispatch and reducer.
 if we want to perform certain kind of operation(like calling Apis) in between dispatching action to reducer then we use middleware.
